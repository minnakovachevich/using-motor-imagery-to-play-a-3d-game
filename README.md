# using-motor-imagery-to-play-a-3d-game
Final project for my Brain-Computer Interface class. We were supposed to make a 3d game in Unity, and on our final exam we were to train the BCI using a volunteer's EEG signals so they could play the game using only their 'thoughts' and with no interference with the computer (e.g. using a keyboard).
